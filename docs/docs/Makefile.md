## File Structure

The Makefile consists of several variables and targets, each serving a specific purpose:

- `INVENTORY_FILE`: Specifies the inventory file for Ansible.
- `PLAYBOOK`: Specifies the main Ansible playbook file.
- `EXTRA_PLAYBOOK`: Specifies an additional playbook file (if needed).
- `ANSIBLE_PLAYBOOK`: Defines the command to execute Ansible playbooks.
- `MINICONDA_LOC`: Specifies the location for Miniconda installation.
- `PIP_LOC`: Specifies the location for Python virtual environment.
- `CURRENT_DIR`: Sets the current directory.
- `INVENTOR_LOC`: Defines the location of the inventory file.

## Targets Overview

The Makefile includes the following targets for executing specific Ansible tasks:

- `venv_pip`: Creates a Python virtual environment using pip.
- `clean`: Cleans up virtual environment directories.
- `install_system`: Installs system-related packages using the main playbook.
- `install_editor`: Installs editor-related packages using the main playbook.
- `install_media`: Installs media-related packages using the main playbook.
- `install_application`: Installs application-related packages using the main playbook.
- `install_webbrowser`: Installs web browser-related packages using the main playbook.
- `backup`: Initiates a backup process using the main playbook.
- `restore`: Initiates a restore process using the main playbook.
- `help`: Displays usage information and available targets.

## Usage

To use the Makefile, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Ansible installed on your system.
2. Customize the variables in the Makefile according to your requirements (e.g., `INVENTORY_FILE`, `PLAYBOOK`, etc.).
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Makefile.
4. Run `make [target]` to execute the desired Ansible task. Replace `[target]` with the target name from the list of available targets.

For example:
- To create a Python virtual environment using pip, run `make venv_pip`.
- To install system-related packages, run `make install_system`.
- For a complete list of available targets and their descriptions, run `make help`.

## Notes

- Ensure proper configuration of variables in the Makefile before executing any targets.
- Review the Makefile contents and adapt them according to your specific environment and requirements.
- Error handling and additional checks can be implemented within Ansible playbooks themselves or by extending the Makefile.
