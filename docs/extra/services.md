## Definition of a Service

When working with JupyterHub, a **Service** is defined as a process that interacts
with the Hub's REST API. A Service may perform a specific or
action or task. For example, the following tasks can each be a unique Service:

- shutting down individuals' single user notebook servers that have been idle
  for some time
- registering additional web servers which should use the Hub's authentication
  and be served behind the Hub's proxy.

Two key features help define a Service:

- Is the Service **managed** by JupyterHub?
- Does the Service have a web server that should be added to the proxy's
  table?

Currently, these characteristics distinguish two types of Services:

- A **Hub-Managed Service** which is managed by JupyterHub
- An **Externally-Managed Service** which runs its own web server and
  communicates operation instructions via the Hub's API.

## Properties of a Service

A Service may have the following properties:

- `name: str` - the name of the service
- `admin: bool (default - false)` - whether the service should have
  administrative privileges
- `url: str (default - None)` - The URL where the service is/should be. If a
  url is specified for where the Service runs its own web server,
  the service will be added to the proxy at `/services/:name`

If a service is also to be managed by the Hub, it has a few extra options:

- `command: (str/Popen list`) - Command for JupyterHub to spawn the service.
      - Only use this if the service should be a subprocess.
      - If command is not specified, the Service is assumed to be managed
        externally.
      - If a command is specified for launching the Service, the Service will
        be started and managed by the Hub.
- `environment: dict` - additional environment variables for the Service.
- `user: str` - the name of a system user to manage the Service. If
  unspecified, run as the same user as the Hub.

## Hub-Managed Services

A **Hub-Managed Service** is started by the Hub, and the Hub is responsible
for the Service's actions. A Hub-Managed Service can only be a local
subprocess of the Hub. The Hub will take care of starting the process and
restarts it if it stops.

While Hub-Managed Services share some similarities with notebook Spawners,
there are no plans for Hub-Managed Services to support the same spawning
abstractions as a notebook Spawner.

If you wish to run a Service in a Docker container or other deployment
environments, the Service can be registered as an
**Externally-Managed Service**, as described below.

## Launching a Hub-Managed Service

A Hub-Managed Service is characterized by its specified `command` for launching
the Service. For example, a 'cull idle' notebook server task configured as a
Hub-Managed Service would include:

- the Service name,
- admin permissions, and
- the `command` to launch the Service which will cull idle servers after a
  timeout interval

This example would be configured as follows in `jupyterhub_config.py`:

```python
c.JupyterHub.services = [
    {
        'name': 'cull-idle',
        'admin': True,
        'command': ['python', '/path/to/cull-idle.py', '--timeout']
    }
]
```

A Hub-Managed Service may also be configured with additional optional
parameters, which describe the environment needed to start the Service process:

- `environment: dict` - additional environment variables for the Service.
- `user: str` - name of the user to run the server if different from the Hub.
   Requires Hub to be root.
- `cwd: path` directory in which to run the Service, if different from the
   Hub directory.

The Hub will pass the following environment variables to launch the Service:

```bash
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_NAME:   The name of the service
JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN:      API token assigned to the service
JUPYTERHUB_API_URL:        URL for the JupyterHub API (default, http://127.0.0.1:8080/hub/api)
JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL:       Base URL of the Hub (https://mydomain[:port]/)
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX: URL path prefix of this service (/services/:service-name/)
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_URL:    Local URL where the service is expected to be listening.
                           Only for proxied web services.
```

For the previous 'cull idle' Service example, these environment variables
would be passed to the Service when the Hub starts the 'cull idle' Service:

```bash
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_NAME: 'cull-idle'
JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN: API token assigned to the service
JUPYTERHUB_API_URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/hub/api
JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL: https://mydomain[:port]
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX: /services/cull-idle/
```

See the JupyterHub GitHub repo for additional information about the
[`cull-idle` example](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/tree/master/examples/cull-idle).

## Externally-Managed Services

You may prefer to use your own service management tools, such as Docker or
systemd, to manage a JupyterHub Service. These **Externally-Managed
Services**, unlike Hub-Managed Services, are not subprocesses of the Hub. You
must tell JupyterHub which API token the Externally-Managed Service is using
to perform its API requests. Each Externally-Managed Service will need a
unique API token, because the Hub authenticates each API request and the API
token is used to identify the originating Service or user.

A configuration example of an Externally-Managed Service with admin access and
running its own web server is:

```python
c.JupyterHub.services = [
    {
        'name': 'my-web-service',
        'url': 'https://10.0.1.1:1984',
        'api_token': 'super-secret',
    }
]
```

In this case, the `url` field will be passed along to the Service as
`JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_URL`.

## Writing your own Services

When writing your own services, you have a few decisions to make (in addition
to what your service does!):

1. Does my service need a public URL?
2. Do I want JupyterHub to start/stop the service?
3. Does my service need to authenticate users?

When a Service is managed by JupyterHub, the Hub will pass the necessary
information to the Service via the environment variables described above. A
flexible Service, whether managed by the Hub or not, can make use of these
same environment variables.

When you run a service that has a url, it will be accessible under a
`/services/` prefix, such as `https://myhub.horse/services/my-service/`. For
your service to route proxied requests properly, it must take
`JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX` into account when routing requests. For example, a
web service would normally service its root handler at `'/'`, but the proxied
service would need to serve `JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX + '/'`.

## Hub Authentication and Services

JupyterHub 0.7 introduces some utilities for using the Hub's authentication
mechanism to govern access to your service. When a user logs into JupyterHub,
the Hub sets a **cookie (`jupyterhub-services`)**. The service can use this
cookie to authenticate requests.

JupyterHub ships with a reference implementation of Hub authentication that
can be used by services. You may go beyond this reference implementation and
create custom hub-authenticating clients and services. We describe the process
below.

The reference, or base, implementation is the [`HubAuth`][HubAuth] class,
which implements the requests to the Hub.

To use HubAuth, you must set the `.api_token`, either programmatically when constructing the class,
or via the `JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

Most of the logic for authentication implementation is found in the
[`HubAuth.user_for_cookie`](services.auth.html#jupyterhub.services.auth.HubAuth.user_for_cookie)
method, which makes a request of the Hub, and returns:

- None, if no user could be identified, or
- a dict of the following form:

  ```python
  {
    "name": "username",
    "groups": ["list", "of", "groups"],
    "admin": False, # or True
  }
  ```

You are then free to use the returned user information to take appropriate
action.

HubAuth also caches the Hub's response for a number of seconds,
configurable by the `cookie_cache_max_age` setting (default: five minutes).

### Flask Example

For example, you have a Flask service that returns information about a user.
JupyterHub's HubAuth class can be used to authenticate requests to the Flask
service. See the `service-whoami-flask` example in the
[JupyterHub GitHub repo](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/tree/master/examples/service-whoami-flask)
for more details.

```python
from functools import wraps
import json
import os
from urllib.parse import quote

from flask import Flask, redirect, request, Response

from jupyterhub.services.auth import HubAuth

prefix = os.environ.get('JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX', '/')

auth = HubAuth(
    api_token=os.environ['JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN'],
    cookie_cache_max_age=60,
)

app = Flask(__name__)


def authenticated(f):
    """Decorator for authenticating with the Hub"""
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        cookie = request.cookies.get(auth.cookie_name)
        if cookie:
            user = auth.user_for_cookie(cookie)
        else:
            user = None
        if user:
            return f(user, *args, **kwargs)
        else:
            # redirect to login url on failed auth
            return redirect(auth.login_url + '?next=%s' % quote(request.path))
    return decorated


@app.route(prefix + '/')
@authenticated
def whoami(user):
    return Response(
        json.dumps(user, indent=1, sort_keys=True),
        mimetype='application/json',
        )
```


### Authenticating tornado services with JupyterHub

Since most Jupyter services are written with tornado,
we include a mixin class, [`HubAuthenticated`][HubAuthenticated],
for quickly authenticating your own tornado services with JupyterHub.

Tornado's `@web.authenticated` method calls a Handler's `.get_current_user`
method to identify the user. Mixing in `HubAuthenticated` defines
`get_current_user` to use HubAuth. If you want to configure the HubAuth
instance beyond the default, you'll want to define an `initialize` method,
such as:

```python
class MyHandler(HubAuthenticated, web.RequestHandler):
    hub_users = {'inara', 'mal'}

    def initialize(self, hub_auth):
        self.hub_auth = hub_auth

    @web.authenticated
    def get(self):
        ...
```


The HubAuth will automatically load the desired configuration from the Service
environment variables.

If you want to limit user access, you can whitelist users through either the
`.hub_users` attribute or `.hub_groups`. These are sets that check against the
username and user group list, respectively. If a user matches neither the user
list nor the group list, they will not be allowed access. If both are left
undefined, then any user will be allowed.


### Implementing your own Authentication with JupyterHub

If you don't want to use the reference implementation
(e.g. you find the implementation a poor fit for your Flask app),
you can implement authentication via the Hub yourself.
We recommend looking at the [`HubAuth`][HubAuth] class implementation for reference,
and taking note of the following process:

1. retrieve the cookie `jupyterhub-services` from the request.
2. Make an API request `GET /hub/api/authorizations/cookie/jupyterhub-services/cookie-value`,
    where cookie-value is the url-encoded value of the `jupyterhub-services` cookie.
    This request must be authenticated with a Hub API token in the `Authorization` header.
    For example, with [requests][]:

    ```python
    r = requests.get(
        '/'.join((["http://127.0.0.1:8081/hub/api",
                   "authorizations/cookie/jupyterhub-services",
                   quote(encrypted_cookie, safe=''),
        ]),
        headers = {
            'Authorization' : 'token %s' % api_token,
        },
    )
    r.raise_for_status()
    user = r.json()
    ```

3. On success, the reply will be a JSON model describing the user:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "inara",
     "groups": ["serenity", "guild"],

   }
   ```

An example of using an Externally-Managed Service and authentication is
[nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer#securing-the-notebook-viewer),
and an example of its configuration is found [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/blob/master/nbviewer/providers/base.py#L94).
nbviewer can also be run as a Hub-Managed Service as described [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer#securing-the-notebook-viewer).
