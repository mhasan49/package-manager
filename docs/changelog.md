## [Unreleased] 0.8

## 0.7

### [0.7.2] - 2017-01-09

#### Added

- Support service environment variables and defaults in `jupyterhub-singleuser`
  for easier deployment of notebook servers as a Service.
- Add `--group` parameter for deploying `jupyterhub-singleuser` as a Service with group authentication.
- Include URL parameters when redirecting through `/user-redirect/`

### Fixed

- Fix group authentication for HubAuthenticated services

### [0.7.1] - 2017-01-02

#### Added

- `Spawner.will_resume` for signaling that a single-user server is paused instead of stopped.
  This is needed for cases like `DockerSpawner.remove_containers = False`,
  where the first API token is re-used for subsequent spawns.
- Warning on startup about single-character usernames,
   caused by common `set('string')` typo in config.

#### Fixed

- Removed spurious warning about empty `next_url`, which is AOK.

### [0.7.0] - 2016-12-2

#### Added

- Implement Services API [\#705](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/705)
- Add `/api/` and `/api/info` endpoints [\#675](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/675)
- Add documentation for JupyterLab, pySpark configuration, troubleshooting,
  and more.
- Add logging of error if adding users already in database.  [\#689](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/689)
- Add HubAuth class for authenticating with JupyterHub. This class can
  be used by any application, even outside tornado.
- Add user groups.
- Add `/hub/user-redirect/...` URL for redirecting users to a file on their own server.


#### Changed

- Always install with setuptools but not eggs (effectively require
  `pip install .`) [\#722](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/722)
- Updated formatting of changelog. [\#711](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/711)
- Single-user server is provided by JupyterHub package, so single-user servers depend on JupyterHub now.

#### Fixed

- Fix docker repository location [\#719](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/719)
- Fix swagger spec conformance and timestamp type in API spec
- Various redirect-loop-causing bugs have been fixed.


#### Removed

- Deprecate `--no-ssl` command line option. It has no meaning and warns if
  used. [\#789](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/789)
- Deprecate `%U` username substitution in favor of `{username}`. [\#748](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/748)
- Removed deprecated SwarmSpawner link.  [\#699](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/699)

## 0.6

### [0.6.1] - 2016-05-04

Bugfixes on 0.6:

- statsd is an optional dependency, only needed if in use
- Notice more quickly when servers have crashed
- Better error pages for proxy errors
- Add Stop All button to admin panel for stopping all servers at once

### [0.6.0] - 2016-04-25

- JupyterHub has moved to a new `jupyterhub` namespace on GitHub and Docker. What was `juptyer/jupyterhub` is now `jupyterhub/jupyterhub`, etc.
- `jupyterhub/jupyterhub` image on DockerHub no longer loads the jupyterhub_config.py in an ONBUILD step. A new `jupyterhub/jupyterhub-onbuild` image does this
- Add statsd support, via `c.JupyterHub.statsd_{host,port,prefix}`
- Update to traitlets 4.1 `@default`, `@observe` APIs for traits
- Allow disabling PAM sessions via `c.PAMAuthenticator.open_sessions = False`. This may be needed on SELinux-enabled systems, where our PAM session logic often does not work properly
- Add `Spawner.environment` configurable, for defining extra environment variables to load for single-user servers
- JupyterHub API tokens can be pregenerated and loaded via `JupyterHub.api_tokens`, a dict of `token: username`.
- JupyterHub API tokens can be requested via the REST API, with a POST request to `/api/authorizations/token`.
  This can only be used if the Authenticator has a username and password.
- Various fixes for user URLs and redirects


## [0.5] - 2016-03-07


- Single-user server must be run with Jupyter Notebook ≥ 4.0
- Require `--no-ssl` confirmation to allow the Hub to be run without SSL (e.g. behind SSL termination in nginx)
- Add lengths to text fields for MySQL support
- Add `Spawner.disable_user_config` for preventing user-owned configuration from modifying single-user servers.
- Fixes for MySQL support.
- Add ability to run each user's server on its own subdomain. Requires wildcard DNS and wildcard SSL to be feasible. Enable subdomains by setting `JupyterHub.subdomain_host = 'https://jupyterhub.domain.tld[:port]'`.
- Use `127.0.0.1` for local communication instead of `localhost`, avoiding issues with DNS on some systems.
- Fix race that could add users to proxy prematurely if spawning is slow.

## 0.4

### [0.4.1] - 2016-02-03

Fix removal of `/login` page in 0.4.0, breaking some OAuth providers.

### [0.4.0] - 2016-02-01

- Add `Spawner.user_options_form` for specifying an HTML form to present to users,
  allowing users to influence the spawning of their own servers.
- Add `Authenticator.pre_spawn_start` and `Authenticator.post_spawn_stop` hooks,
  so that Authenticators can do setup or teardown (e.g. passing credentials to Spawner,
  mounting data sources, etc.).
  These methods are typically used with custom Authenticator+Spawner pairs.
- 0.4 will be the last JupyterHub release where single-user servers running IPython 3 is supported instead of Notebook ≥ 4.0.


## [0.3] - 2015-11-04

- No longer make the user starting the Hub an admin
- start PAM sessions on login
- hooks for Authenticators to fire before spawners start and after they stop,
  allowing deeper interaction between Spawner/Authenticator pairs.
- login redirect fixes

## [0.2] - 2015-07-12

- Based on standalone traitlets instead of IPython.utils.traitlets
- multiple users in admin panel
- Fixes for usernames that require escaping

## 0.1 - 2015-03-07

First preview release
